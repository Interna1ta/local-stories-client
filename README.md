# Towntype

I started this project as the final project of [Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp](www.ironhack.com/). 

Towntype is a hyperlocal community microblogging service. We give voice to communities.

I've started designing it with [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and then give some interactivity with [inVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/).

## Technologies

For the frontend (this repository) I used Angular CLI as a project generator and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) to style.

For the backend [Local-Stories-Server](https://github.com/Interna1ta/local-stories-server) I used Express generator, and some packages.

The local database was [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/), and [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) as a local server.
And [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) as a cloud platform for the deployment.
