# Local-stories

This project is the final project of Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp. 

It is a hyperlocal community stories service.

## User stories

User can:

* Signup
* Login
* Logout
* Create a story
* See all the stories written before
* Follow/unfollow other users

## Technologies

For the frontend (this repository) I used Angular CLI as a project generator and SASS to style.

For the backend [Local-Stories-Server](https://github.com/Interna1ta/local-stories-server) I used Express generator, and some packages.

The local database was [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/), and [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) as a local server.
And [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) as a cloud platform for the deployment.
